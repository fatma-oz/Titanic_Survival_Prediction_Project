**TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

*In this project, "What kinds of people are most likely to survive on the Titanic?" A predictive model answering the question was developed using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

*Project of Titanic is END TO END work.

*This classification problem project includes "Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization and Machine Learning".

*Matplotlib and seaborn library are used for visualizations.

*Variable transformations and feature engineering done.

*"LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, KNN, LinearSVC, SVC, CART, RF, GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost " machine learning models were tried.

*Developed with "XGBoost" model.

*The best parameters were found with the GridSearchCV method by tuning the model.

*Finally, the significance of the variables was demonstrated using barplot.
